*  The ***Gender*** and ***Type*** of the name has to be selected using the Drop Down Menu before searching.

*  The "Search" Button generates random names below.

*  The "Clear" button simply clears the name that is generated on the screen.

*  If you like the name that's generated, click the "Save Name" Button, which will indicate that the name has been saved by showing "SAVED", below.
     A button named "SAVED NAMES" will appear on the top right corner which takes you to a new screen where the names are arranged based on their type.

*  The saved names can be printed out in the form of a text file by clicking the "Save as txt file" button, which creates a .txt file in the Desktop of the User.

*  The saved names can be deleted by clicking the "Clear" button.

* Multiple text files can be created which will be named numerically. (names_2.txt, names_3.txt ....)

## Accessing Data

*  The names are **webscraped** using ***BeautifulSoup***.

*  **100** Male and Female, first names and last names are collected.

*  The Full Names that are generated are a random combination of M/F first name and last name.
